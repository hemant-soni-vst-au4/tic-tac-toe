The object of Tic Tac Toe is to get three consecutive cells (row, column or diagonal). You play on a three by three game board. The first player is known as X and the second is O. Players alternate placing Xs and Os on the game board until either opponent has three consecutive cells or all nine squares are filled. X always goes first, and in the event that no one has three consecutive cells, the stalemate is called a cat game.
